                            <p>Hi, this is Rahul. I belong to an upper middle class but always lived a poor middle-class life, and it was not a choice. We were living in a Joint family; my Indian readers can relate to this. It was all great except the
                                financial planning and ability to make the right decision. I’m from Gujarat, Entrepreneurship runs in our blood. We take risk, end number of risk and that pays off too. Still something goes wrong, and that’s life. I
                                didn’t find a single person in my life who didn’t make a wrong decision. We all make mistakes; we all make wrong decision. And one thing we don’t do is to create a backup. I was 15 and head of our family told me that
                                we are in debt. It was 2004 and the debt was in crores. I am good with number, I always was and I did the math and figured, it will take around 50 years to clear the debt, if we don’t do anything. I wanted to do something
                                about it, not about the debt but about the future. I was doing the opposite they were doing. I didn’t have a clue about investment. So, I started saving money and reading “Business Section” in the NEWS paper. Few things
                                there was on a repeat mode and that is “Investing”. I knew someone who were doing this. So, I went up to him and asked him if he can help me. I did what he said and I lost everything I had. I didn’t lose faith in investing.
                                I started learning about it, how it works and how to pick the right stock. I saved some more and this time I have invested only half and I didn’t take the help from a friend. I was investing in his Demat, that was the
                                only help. I Bought, “Titan Industries” that was the very first stock I bought and I still have it. This is how I begin. After that, I saw 2008 crash and survived; because, I didn’t sell a single stock I had in my portfolio.
                                In fact, I bought “Bajaj Finance” with few others and I still have it. This is how I learned the patience. Life is not a 100 meters sprint, It’s a marathon. Doesn’t matter who comes first as long as you finish the line.
                                I am doing great with my life now; I know others who made their lives better. But I’ll tell you this. Nothing turned upside down over night. Neither for me nor the people I know. In my case it is 15 long years. And
                                yes, I am debt free and I have an investment and security for my family. I made a guilt free decision, and that’s the decision I am proud of</p>
                            <p>My vision is to make every Indian be well educated about the finances that can set them free. When it comes to money, we all take advice from friends and relatives like they know everything. But, they don’t. Read this with
                                excitement, because I want every Indian to deal with their financial problems by hiring a financial advisor. An advisor who asks difficult questions and create a roadmap for their client’s best interest. No one could
                                turn around your life overnight. I believe, its not the luck but the determination and patience. I have seen 2008 crash and watching COVID-19 Pandemic right now. Nothing changes for me, as this is never going to last
                                forever. I am the CEO of Royal Monarch and I founded this company with my team; so, every Indian have someone to trust with their finances</p>
